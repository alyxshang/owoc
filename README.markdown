fn main(){
  let msg: String = String::from("Hello World!");
  println!("{}", &msg);
}

(OwO)
```

### Specification v1

- Each ***OwO*** document has to have the extension `*.owo`.
- Each ***OwO*** document has to start and end with the `(OwO)` declaration.
- The number of `<3` expressions determines the level of a heading: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc..
- Since we're channeling the ***KAWAII*** energy of all kawaii creatures, the tilde is a list indicator.
- Link elements are enclosed by normal parentheses. Text and URL are separated by an `@`.
- Code blocks are enclosed by a cringing *kaomoji* (`>-<`).
- Link elements are enclosed by curly parentheses. The alt text and URL are separated by an `@`.
